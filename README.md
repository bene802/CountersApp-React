My first React app.

# Notes

* Component
* Virtual DOM and Real DOM
* Loop in a list - map
* Conditional expression - 
  * new a function 
  * logic expression (&&)
* onClick event - pass reference, using arrow function
* update state - setState()
* pass data among components 
  * props (parent to child)
  * raise event (child to parent)
* Single Source of Truth - remove state of one component, only use props
* Lift state up - share data between components in same level -> lift the data to its parent
* Stateless functional component
* Life circle hook



# Run App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
